At the request of Slowpoke, representing the FTB team, we have removed the feature that allows downloading FTB modpacks from Prism Launcher. [GitHub PR][pr-ftb-removal]

Existing instances of FTB Modpacks will remain functional, but with the next release, downloading FTB packs within the launcher will no longer be possible.

A way to import FTB Modpacks from the FTB App is planned, though no work was done yet. If you think you can help out, [join the development over here][issue-ftb-app-import]!

The reason for this request from the FTB team seems to be related to some launchers attempting to monetize FTB Packs.
